###  ðŸ’»: ABOUT PROJECT :
- :zap: Hi, this is the weather-cli utility.
        It is very easy to use this application: 
          <br>
          - First, choose one of the methods that work for you: HTTPS, SSH, GitHub CLI to add code to your project.
          - run the command 'npm install'
          - with the command 'node' you can execute the main file, by default in this project this is 'weather.js'. Command for example 'node weather.js'

        But before you can use the app, you must pass the environment the keys you will use to query the current weather!
          Key arguments:
          - '-t': [API_KE], The key must be obtained from this resource: https://openweathermap.org/ 
            "It is necessary to register and in the personal cabinet to get [API_KEY]".
          - '-s': [CITY], with this command you enter the city where you are interested in the weather
          - '-h': with this command you call the command description and usage rule in the application itself 
          ######
          For example command: 
          -- node weather.js -t [your API_KEY];
          -- node wethaer.js -s [city of interest]Ð¶
          -- node weathr.js [default command, getting the current weather from your keys ]
